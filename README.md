# HemoðŸ©¸
*"A single drop of blood can make a huge difference."* ðŸ©¸  
Hemo is an AI Chatbot that helps Blood Donors learn more about Blood Donation &amp; predict Blood Donation Patterns.

# Scenario
Every 2 seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood, and more than 50,000 units of blood are needed each year at Cedars-Sinai alone.While 38% of the American population is eligible to give blood, only 2% actually donates. While this is just the condition of America, the scene is much worse in under-developed & developing countries like Rwanda , Bangladesh & many more. It's become so scarce to find blood donors that Rwanda is even using drones to supply blood from big cities to remote villages. In Bangladesh alone there's thousands of people that need blood everday. Most people lack the awarness about blood donation activities. So even if there are hundreds of blood donation camps, we still don't get blood donors. Hence the need for proper encouragement & information on blood donation. Hemo aims to encourage the young population through Generative AI to give proper assessment on the donors blood, manage thier donor information & also predict Blood Donation Patterns using Generative AI.  
Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers: in January 2019, "Nationwide, the Red Cross saw 27,000 fewer blood donations over the holidays than they see at other times of the year." Machine learning can be used to learn the patterns in the data to help to predict future blood donations and therefore save more lives.

# Solution

### **`Currently Hemo can generate Pairplot from Blood Transfusion CSV data to predict Blood Donation Patterns.I'm currently working on adding the nearby blood donation center feature & automatic suggestion feature for different blood types`**
