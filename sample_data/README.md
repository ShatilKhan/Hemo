## Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set  
Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan.

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build an FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database.
